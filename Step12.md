    - Suitable for evaluation in production or near-production environments.

# Install SonarQube on VM-Sonar.

    NOTE: 
    In this guide, we will demonstrate the installation and configurations using an 
    Azure VM server Datacenter 2016  and sql 2016 express.

> ### **STEP 1**

## Install Java JRE

**As mentioned in the Prerequisites section, a Java virtual machine (JVM) is required.
If the installed JVM meets the version requirements listed, you can skip this section. Otherwise, follow the steps below to install Java.**

- Download [Java SE Runtime Environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) and make sure you select the one corresponding to your current operation system.

	NOTE: 
	SonarQube does not require the full Java JDK (Java SE Development Kit) 
	to run- you only need the JRE (Java SE Runtime Environment).
